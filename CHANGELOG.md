---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-25

### New Features - Media Clipboard

- **Media clipboard (schema v4)**: Copy/paste images, videos, PDFs through the panel
  - Inline thumbnails for images, MIME icons for other media
  - Dual export: JSON text-only or ZIP full backup with media
  - Orphan media cleanup on startup and on import
  - Per-item size capped at 1 MB to prevent `TransactionTooLargeException`
- **Independent Pinned & Todos tabs**: Each tab has its own database table (true COPY semantics)
  - Per-entry tags with inline tag editor
  - Todo status cycle: active → planned → completed; one-tap done toggle
  - Tab-aware delete; pinned/todo items protected from expiry and size cleanup
- **Inline editing**: Tap pencil on any text entry to edit, save, cancel, or delete
  - Search filter preserved when entering edit mode
  - UI locked during edit to prevent silent data loss
- **Regex search**: VSCode-style `.*` toggle with `*`/`?` glob shorthand, invalid regex shows red
- **Filter dialog overhaul**: Per-tab filters (date / status / tags) with OR / AND tag match toggle
- **Three visibility toggles**: text-only mode, Pinned tab, Todos tab — independent

### Fixed

- **#71 Clipboard freeze on open** — async DB load removes the 2–3 second UI thread hang
- **Entry Duration "Never expire"** honored end-to-end; stale 7-day expiries rescued
- **#70 Profile/clipboard import** — scoped-storage fallbacks + `json_base64` bypass
- **Tag panel input capture** — added tag-mode delegation to `KeyEventReceiverBridge`
- **Clipboard search bar text invisible** — wrong theme context for resolution
- **IME toasts replaced** with tab-icon pulse (toasts render behind keyboard panel)
- **Edit-mode key routing** — arrow keys, Enter, paste, cut, select-all all work on pinned/todo tabs
- **Tag filter "match any/all"** no longer overlaps in narrow panels
- **F-Droid `Version:`/`VersionCode:`** lines restored to release body for auto-update

### Performance

- **Per-language predictor eviction** on language switch (configured languages retained)
- **VocabularyTrie compacted** (~34 MB savings per trie instance)
- **Coil image cache** capped at 32 MB (was ~250 MB default)
- **ContentObserver** replaces 500 ms IME-status polling
- **Heap-allocation storms** in clipboard size calculations eliminated
- **Clipboard import** wrapped in single transaction
- **Gradle daemon** enabled

### Web Demo & Site

- **cleverkeys.app** rewritten in Astro 5 + Svelte 5 + Tailwind v4
- **43 wiki pages** migrated to Astro content collections
- **ONNX swipe demo** uses APK-shipped encoder/decoder weights
- **Demo settings panel**: dictionary, beam width, batched beam search, auto-insert, timing log

### Testing

- 1046 JVM tests + ~1100 instrumented tests on Pixel 7 / API 34
- 55 + 48 clipboard feature tests, 45 inline-edit tests, 31 regex-search tests, 28 v1.3.0-review-fix regression tests
