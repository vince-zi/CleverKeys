Frequently asked questions about using CleverKeys keyboard.

## Typing Numbers & Symbols (Subkeys / Short Swipes)

**Q: How do I type numbers and symbols quickly?**

A: Use **short swipes** (subkeys) on letter keys. Each key has up to 8 subkeys mapped to the cardinal directions N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW:
- **Swipe NORTHEAST** on `Q` for `1` (hint: start in the SW corner)
- Each direction on each key can trigger a different character or action
- Directions are determined by the angle of your swipe

**Q: How do I customize what short swipes do?**

A: Go to **Settings → Activities → Per-Key Customization** to assign custom actions (characters, symbols, or commands) to each of the 8 directions on any key.

## Cursor Control & Navigation

**Q: How do I move the cursor without tapping the screen?**

A: **Swipe on the spacebar** to move the cursor:
- Cursor movement is **proportional to your swipe speed and distance**
- Faster/longer swipes move further; slow precise swipes give fine control
- Works in both directions

**Q: What is TrackPoint Mode?**

A: TrackPoint mode provides laptop-style continuous cursor navigation:
- **Long-press the nav key** (between spacebar and enter) to enter trackpoint mode
- Move your finger like a joystick to control cursor direction
- Release to exit trackpoint mode

## Text Selection & Deletion

**Q: How do I select and delete text?**

A: For **Selection-Delete mode**:
1. **Short swipe on the backspace key** to initiate
2. **Keep your finger held down** after the swipe
3. **Move your finger like a joystick** to select text (left/right for characters, up/down for lines)
4. Release to delete the selected text

Swipe left on backspace deletes the word before cursor.

## Language & Input Options

**Q: How do I quickly switch between languages?**

A: Use the **primary/secondary language toggle subkeys**:
1. Set your languages in **Settings → Multi-Language** (Primary and Secondary)
2. The toggle subkeys cycle between them
3. Both languages contribute to swipe predictions when Multi-Language mode is enabled

## Emoji & Clipboard

**Q: How do I access emojis?**

A: **Swipe SOUTHWEST on the Fn key** to open the emoji picker:
- Search will auto-populate with nearby text
- Categories tab with all emoji groups
- Recents for quick access to frequently used
- Search by keyword or emoji name
- 119 text emoticons (kaomoji) also included

**Q: How do I use the clipboard?**

A: **Swipe SOUTHWEST on the Ctrl key** to open clipboard history:
- **History tab**: Recent clipboard items (text + media)
- **Pinned tab**: Items you've saved for quick access
- **Todos tab**: Items marked as todos
- Tap an item's content to expand it (text) or paste it (media)
- Images, videos, and PDFs show thumbnails in the panel
- Use the icon buttons to paste, move to pinned, or copy as todo
- Re-copying text already in history won't duplicate or reorder it (tip: use search instead)
- Password manager and 'sensitive' flagged clippings are excluded by default

**Q: How do I paste images from clipboard?**

A: Copy an image in any app (Gallery, Chrome, etc.) — it appears in clipboard history with a thumbnail. Tap the entry to paste it into the current app via `commitContent`. Most messaging apps support this.

## Swipe Typing (Glide Typing)

**Q: How does swipe typing work?**

A: Touch the first letter of your word, slide your finger through each letter without lifting, then release on the last letter. Faster may yield better results.

**Tip:** Increase 'Length Penalty (Alpha)' for English (~1.5), decrease for other languages (and increase Vocab Frequency Weight).

**Q: Can I swipe other languages?**

A: Yes, but this currently requires using the qwerty latin layout and manually tuning several settings to achieve useable output - see FAQ entry above and Prefix Boost settings (these are very sensitive; try small changes).
